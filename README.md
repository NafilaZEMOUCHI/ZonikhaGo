# ZonikhaGo
Hi 
i used to have a cat named Zonikha , i know i know ,a bad name , but it suited her , she was a grey cat , that used to live in the streets and  probably got beaten up by people and run after by dogs . 
Well , she is gone ! she disappeared , but my brother found her dead , killed by dogs .
Wipe up your tears and help me build a project where i get to know where my cat would hang out , without sticking a GPS chip in his bracelet or putting it under his skin . 
The idea is to understand how cats behave in the city . Males like to set their territory ! that's a key concept to understand how cats navigate ina city !
